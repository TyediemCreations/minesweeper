JavaScript Minesweeper

Simple Minesweeper game; user can specify height, width and number of mines. 
Grid is created with (height,width) cells; selecting a cell will reveal the number of adjacent cells which contain mines.
Game ends either when user selects a cell containing a mine (game over) or when user selects all cells which do not contain mines (game won)
